MMC
=
MMC is a disk-based programm for counting (w,k)-minimizers from (possibly gzipped) FASTQ/FASTA files. This program has been built on top of [KMC3](https://github.com/refresh-bio).

Installation
=
```sh
git clone https://github.com/at-cg/MMC.git
cd MMC
```
After that, you can run ```make``` to compile mmc, mmc_dump, and mmc_tools applications.

**Note:** Some parts of MMC use C++14 features, so you need a compatible C++ compiler, e.g., gcc 4.9+ or clang 3.4+

Binaries
=
After compilation you will obtain two binaries:
* bin/mmc - the main program for counting minimizer occurrences
* bin/mmc_dump - the program listing minimizers in a database produced by mmc
* bin/mmc_tools - the program allowing to manipulate mmc databases (set operations, transformations, etc.)
